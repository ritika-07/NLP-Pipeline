Candles, toffees and cakes are tied with ribbon and paper napkins to the tree. \nThe Christmas Tree in ancient times was considered a symbol of the continuity of life. \nIt is believed that evil spirits stay away from the house and keep the flow of positive energy. \nThey are available in many sizes in the market.
