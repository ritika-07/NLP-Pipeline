It is celebrated on 25 December every year. It is the most important festival of the Christians. \nOne of the major attractions of the Christmas festival is the Christmas Tree. A Christmas Tree is a decorated tree. \nIt is usually an evergreen conifer traditionally associated with the celebration of Christmas. Candles, toffees and cakes are tied with ribbon and paper napkins to the tree. \nThe Christmas Tree in ancient times was considered a symbol of the continuity of life. \nIt is believed that evil spirits stay away from the house and keep the flow of positive energy. \nThey are available in many sizes in the market. A person disguised as Santa Claus distributes sweets among the children. \nFamily reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Children get dressed in new clothes. Prayers are offered in churches.\"\"\"\ndoc = nlp(about_text)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b6230257c638f1731ffa0c5585be03f478b8789c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"doc._.has_coref","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0f49d40ca6e2427972548cdee82dbab6171cbe43"},"cell_type":"code","source":"doc._.coref_clusters","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
